APPROACH
1. create a class node ,which will have arraylist for children and set parent to null,(genesis node)
2. THHE CHILDREN AND PARENT CAN BE SET USING FUNCTIONS
3.Childnode will feature there parents
4. each object will have a uniqe encryption with its hash code
5. verify using hashcode
6. functions too edit value
7.arraylist for recording the ownership
8. chain will fing the depth to leaf
9. longest chain using the logic of diameter for tree
10.merge operation includes changes in parent node and changes down the parent
